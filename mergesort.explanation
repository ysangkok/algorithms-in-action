Top-down recursive mergesort breaks the array to be sorted in half,
recursively sorts both halves, and merges the two sorted halves.
The work of sorting is done in the merging function.

The algorithm breaks the array in half, regardless of the order of the
data, and so is O(n log n) and Big-Theta(n log n)
