The algorithm window, on the right, displays the workings of the
algorithm visually. To start an animation, select Step or Run in
the animation window. Highlighting in the adjacent pseudocode
window shows the code that the animation is illustrating. The
animation window contains other controls, some of which are
specific to particular algorithms.
<p>The pseudocode window controls the level of detail shown at any
given time. To get more detailed pseudocode, click on any closed
folder. Contract by clicking on open folders.</p>
<p>The top section of the explanation window, on the left, gives an
overview of the algorithm. The bottom section of the explanation
window gives an explanation of any particular line of pseudocode.
To activate the explanation, click on the line of pseudocode that
you would like explained.</p>
<p>A help window displays help for the generic animation control.
buttons. For the algorithm-specific controls, pull-down menus show
the range of options available.</p>
