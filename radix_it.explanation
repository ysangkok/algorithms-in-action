Radix exchange sort, sometimes called binary quicksort, is a variant of quicksort.

The first partitioning is done around the most significant bit, and subsequent partitions around the next most significant bits.

If every bit is examined, then for keys of b bits, there would be O(b) passes, with each pass examining every item, leading to a time complexity of O(bn).  In practice, where keys are sparsely and randomly distributed, the file will be sorted after log n passes, for another O(n log n) sort.
